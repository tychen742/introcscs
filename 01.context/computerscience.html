the learning of computational concepts and problem-solving skills using the C# programming language.</p>

<span id="index-1"></span><h2><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>The IPO Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ipo-model" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The input–process–output (IPO) model is widely used in systems analysis
and software engineering for describing the structure of an information processing
task or process. Computers are used to process mathematical calculations, automate
business decisions, and analyze textual data to generate language models, and so on.
But in a computer system, these tasks all follow the same structure and go through the
same stages. For example, when performing a Google search, you give an input to the
search engine, Google processes it, and return back answers to you.
That’s what computer systems do: They take in information, process the information,
and output the resulted outcome.</p>

<p>To learn a natural language, we may start with some basic words for daily usage. Similarly, when it
comes to programming languages, we also start with the basic elements of programming such as how
computers represents numbers, letters, words, and perform arithmetic operations. Next, we learn the
vocabulary of programming, including terms like statement, operator, expression, value, and type <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f1" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.
We then put the vocabulary together according to the <em>syntax</em> of a programming language to give
instructions to the computers to do the work for us.</p>
<p>A computer program is a set of instructions (written in the specific notations specified by
a programming language) given to computers. Interestingly, there are only a small number of ideas
that we need to know when learning how to giving instructions to to computers,
across probably all programming languages. Those basic constructs include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>input</p></li>
<li><p>output</p></li>
<li><p>math</p></li>
<li><p>sequence: instructions are executed one after another</p></li>
<li><p>selection: decision-making; namely choosing between alternative paths of actions within a program</p></li>
<li><p>iteration: repetition controlled by either count or condition</p></li>
</ul>

<span id="index-3"></span><h2><span class="section-number">1.2.3. </span>Problem-solving<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-solving" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Computer science is a scientific discipline, so learning to program could mean learning a new way
of thinking; as Allen Downey <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f1" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> puts it, to “think like a computer scientist.”
As Downey says, “this way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics,
engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to
denote ideas – specifically computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components
into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the
behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f1" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.</p>
<p>For most learners, the idea central in learning computer science and information systems is problem-solving,
meaning “the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a
solution clearly and accurately,” [f#2]_ and we expect to hon our problem-solving skills
through learning how to code and, in turn, obtaining a skillset to use and create computer
programs and tools to solve problems.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.2.4. </span>Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithms" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In computer science, the solution to a problem is called <em>algorithm</em>, which is a list of step-by-step instructions,
much like a recipe for cooking a dish, that will solve the problem under consideration if followed
exactly. Programming is the process of implementing an algorithmic solution. By using notations
of a programming language, we create a computer program containing specific instructions to the
computer to solve the certain problem.</p>

<span id="index-4"></span><span id="id4"></span><h2><span class="section-number">1.2.5. </span>Data Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-representation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p id="index-5">In modern electronic computers the most basic bit of data
(actually called a <em>bit</em>) is held by two-state switches, often
in the form of a higher voltage vs. a grounded state.  The symbolic representation
is often 0 vs. 1.  This symbolism comes from the representation of integers
in <em>binary notation</em>, also called <em>base 2</em>:
It is a place value system, but where each place
in a numeral is a 0 or a 1 and represents a power of two, so 1101 in binary
can be viewed in our decimal system as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1)2^3+(1)2^2+(0)2^1+(1)2^0=8+4+0+1=13\)</span>.</p>
<p>Computer hardware can only handle a limited number of bits at a time,
and memory space is limited, so usually integers are stored in a limited
space, like 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits.
We illustrate with the smallest, 8 bits, called a <em>byte</em>.  Since
each bit has two possible states, 8 bits have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^8=256\)</span> possible states.
Directly considered as binary numerals, they represent 0 through
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^8-1=255\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also want to represent negative numbers, and have about half of the available
codes for them.  An 8-bit signed integer in <em>twos complement</em> notation
represents 0 through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^7-1\)</span>
just as the unsigned numbers do.  These are all the 8-bit codes with a leading 0.
A negative number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> in the range <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-2^7=-128\)</span> through -1,
is represented by what would be
the unsigned notation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n+2^8\)</span>.  These will be all the
8-bit codes with a leading 1.
For example -3 is represented like unsigned 256 - 3 = 253: 11111101 in binary.</p>
<p id="index-6">Limited precision approximation of real numbers are stored in something like
scientific notation, except in binary,  roughly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm(m)2^e\)</span>,
with a sign, mantissa m and exponent e. Both e and m have
fixed numbers of bits, so the limited options for the
mantissa restricts the <em>precision</em> of the numbers, and the limited options
for the exponent restricts the <em>range</em>. Data on these limits for
different sized numeric codes is in <a class="reference internal" href="../02.data/types-and-conversions.html#value-types"><span class="std std-ref">Value Types and Conversions</span></a>.</p>
<p>Once you have numbers, all sorts of other kinds of data can be encoded:
Characters
like on your keyboard each have a numerical code associated with each one.  For
example the unicode for the letter A is 65.  Images are often
represented as a sequence of colored pixels.  Since the human eye is only
sensitive to three specific colors, red, green, and blue,
a pixel is represented by a numerical intensity
for each of the three colors.</p>

<section id="index-7">
<span id="id5"></span><h2><span class="section-number">1.2.6. </span>Programming Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#index-7" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Programming languages can</p>
<p>The next big step past assembler was the advent of
<em>high level</em> languages, with instructions more like normal mathematical or
English expressions.  Examples are Fortran (1954) and Cobol (1959).
A Fortran statement for calculating a slope like</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S=(Y-V)/(X-U)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>might require seven or or more machine code instructions.</p>
<p>To use a Fortran program required three steps: write it (onto punch cards
originally), compile it to machine code, and execute the machine code.
The compiler would still be architecture specific, but the compiler for
an architecture would only need to be written once, and then any number of
programs could be compiled and run.</p>
<p>A later variant for executing a high-level language is
an <em>interpreter</em>.  An interpreter translates the high-level language
into machine code, and immediately executes it, not storing the
machine code for later
use, so every time a statement in the code is executed again,
the translation needs to be redone.  Interpreters are also
machine-specific.</p>
<p>Some later languages like Java and C# use a hybrid approach: A compiler,
that can run on any machine, does most of the work by
translating the high-level language program
into a low-level <em>virtual machine</em>
language called a <em>bytecode</em>.  This is not the machine language for any real machine,
but the bytecode is simple
enough that writing an interpreter for it is very easy.
Again the interpreter for the bytecode must be machine-specific.
In this approach:</p>
<p>Program source =&gt; COMPILER =&gt; bytecode =&gt; INTERPRETER =&gt; execution</p>

<p id="index-9">In the early years of computer development, computers only understand low-level lanugages:
machine code (binary digits) to be read and interpreted directly by a computer, and assembly
language, consisting of short words to represent machine code instructions. Over time,
high-level languages such C, C++, Perl, and Java were creaerd to make programming more
efficient. However, the source code written in hight-level programming languages need to be
translated into machine code for execution. The two common types of tools for the translation
are <em>interpreters</em> and <em>compilers</em>.</p>

open-source software projects that make C# available for multiple platforms:
Windows, Mac, or Linux machines.  With a substantial fraction of students having their own
machine that does  <em>not</em> run Windows, this flexibility is important.</p>
