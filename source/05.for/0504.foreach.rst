``foreach`` Statement 
=====================

.. index:: statement; foreach
   foreach; syntax 

A C# ``foreach`` works like a for loop, except it does not use the header 
(initializer, condition, and iterator) for ``conditional`` looping flow control. Instead, 
the ``foreach`` loop iterates through each element in a given sequence or collection of data and 
runs a set of instructions once for each of the elements. In other words, the 
``foreach`` loop is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array 
(or other data sets). 

In the case of ``for`` loop in C#, the local loop variable refers to the index of an 
array whereas, in the case of a ``foreach`` loop, the loop variable refers to 
the ``values`` of the array.

In ``for`` loop, the loop variable is of type ``int``. The reason for this is, 
here the ``loop variable`` refers to the index position of the array. For the ``foreach`` 
loop, the ``data type`` of the ``loop variable`` must be the same as the 
*type of the values stored in the array*. For example, if you have a string array, 
then the loop variable must be of type string. 

The syntax of the foreach loop is::

   foreach (type variableName in arrayName) 
   {
      // code block to be executed
   }

A ``foreach`` statement only works with an object that holds a sequence or collection of data.
We will see many more kinds of sequences later. For now we can illustrate
with a string, which is a sequence of characters. Observe and test the 
following two pieces of code in ``csharprepl`` to see how ``foreach`` 
differs from the ``for`` statement. 

Say you want to print out some Unicode/ASCII code 
for certain characters. To achieve that using C# ``for`` loop, the code could look like::
   
   > string str = "ABCabc";
   > for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)  
     { 
         Console.WriteLine("Unicode for {0} is {1}", i, (int)str[i]); 
     }
   Unicode for 0 is 65
   Unicode for 1 is 66
   Unicode for 2 is 67
   Unicode for 3 is 97
   Unicode for 4 is 98
   Unicode for 5 is 99

   > 

As you can see, with a ``for`` loop, you refer to the individual characters by its index 
and then cast it to ``int``::
   
    (int)str[i]
   
Since strings are considered as arrays consisting of ``char`` type characters, we can loop 
through a string using a ``foreach`` statement using type ``char`` and *cast* to print out 
the underlying ``int`` Unicode value of each character. To achieve the same results using 
the ``foreach`` loop, the code would look like the following (pay attention to the local 
loop variable ``char ch``; type is required as usual)::

   > string str = "ABCabc";
     foreach (char ch in str) {
        Console.WriteLine("Unicode for {0} is {1}.", ch, (int)ch);
     }
   Unicode for A is 65.
   Unicode for B is 66.
   Unicode for C is 67.
   Unicode for a is 97.
   Unicode for b is 98.
   Unicode for c is 99. 

As you can see, in a ``foreach`` loop, we do not rely on array indexing to refer to the 
elements. Instead, we refer to the elements directly with the local loop variable (``ch``) 
declared with the type (``char`` in this case). 

As you see in the preceding example, the ``foreach`` heading feeds us one
character from ``str`` each time through, using the name ``ch`` 
to refer to it. Since any new variable name must be declared with a type in C#, 
so ``ch`` is preceded in the heading by its type, ``char``. Then we can use 
``ch`` inside the body of the loop. 


**``foreach`` vs. for loop**

Some of the advantages/disadvantages of ``foreach`` over the ``for`` loop are:

- foreach not involve variable setup (iterates over each element of the array).
- foreach are more concise and readable than the indexing ``for`` statement.
- foreach performs less well than the for loop because the foreach loop creates a 
  copy of the collection (instead of referring to it using indices) when 
  iterating and that uses extra memory.

The foreach loop does have some limitations: [#foreach-limits]_
- They don’t keep track of the index of the item.
- They cannot iterate backwards. The loop can only go forward in one step. 
- If you wish to modify the array, the foreach loop isn’t the most suitable option.
- The foreach loop cannot execute two-decision statements at once.

.. warning::  
   
   *If* you have explicit need to refer to the indices of the items in the sequence,
   then a ``foreach`` statement does not work for you. 
   

``break`` in ``foreach``
--------------------------

With a ``foreach`` loop, which has no explicit continuation condition, 
the ``break`` could be more clearly useful. Here is a variant if you do not care 
about the specific location of the target::

    bool found = false;
    
    foreach (string s in a) {
       if (s == target) 
       {
          found = true;
          break;
       }
    }

    if (found) {
       Console.WriteLine("Target found");
    } else {
       Console.WriteLine("Target not found");
    } 


Note that for the for and foreach loops, you could do all the same things 
with ``while`` loops, which you will learn in subsequent chapters, but there 
are many situations where ``foreach`` loops and ``for`` loops are more convenient 
and easier to read.
