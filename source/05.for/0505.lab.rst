Lab: for Loops
================

- Note that the course policy is that you should not use generative AI 
  without authorization. If you are suspected to have used generative AI 
  and not able to explain/reproduce your work when requested, all your 
  **related assignments throughout the semester will be regraded as 0**.

#. Create a dotnet console app project (:ref:`create-project`), if you 
   have not, in your *USERNAME*/workspace/introcscs directory; called it 
   **Ch05ForLoop**. 
#. Prepare your code in VS Code. 
#. Use the file Program.cs to code.    
#. The namespace of this project is *IntroCSCS*. 
#. The class name of this project is *Ch05ForLoop*. 
#. When executing code, you will only use the Main() method in class *Ch05ForLoop*. 
#. You will prepare methods in the same class to be called from the Main() method. 
#. Use a Word document to prepare your assignment. 
#. Number the questions and **annotate** your answers (using // in code when 
   appropriate) to show your understanding. 
#. For coding questions, screenshot and paste 1) your code in VS Code and 2) the 
   results of the code's execution (**command prompt** and **username** are part 
   of the execution).


Goals for this lab:

- Practice with loops. You are encouraged to use a ``for`` loop where appropriate.
- Use nested loops where appropriate.


Loop Lab
--------------------

This part of the lab comes from :repsrc:`loop_lab_stub/loop_lab.cs`. You may refer to the 
code while answering the questions here.

   #. From terminal, go to your Ch05ForLoop project folder.
   #. ``code .`` + Enter from within the Ch05ForLoop directory. 
   #. Start working on the methods. 
   
Your tasks is to Fill in method bodies for each part below: 

.. index:: PrintReps

#.  Complete method ``PrintReps`` 

    .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/loop_lab_stub/loop_lab.cs
       :start-after: PrintReps chunk
       :end-before: body
       :dedent: 6

    Hint:  How would you do something like the example
    ``PrintReps("Ok", 9)`` or with a higher count by hand?  
    Probably count under your breath as you write:
    
    .. code-block:: none

        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
       OkOkOkOkOkOkOkOkOk
    
    This is a counting loop.
    

    .. index:: StringOfReps
    
#.  Complete method ``StringOfReps``  

    .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/loop_lab_stub/loop_lab.cs
       :start-after: StringOfReps chunk
       :end-before: body
       :dedent: 6

    Note the distinction from the previous part:  Here the method prints nothing.
    Its work is *returned* as a single string. You have to build up the final
    string.
    

    .. index:: Factorial
    
#. Complete method ``Factorial``: (A factorial, in mathematics, is the product of 
   all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer and 
   denoted by that integer and an exclamation point.)
    
   .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/loop_lab_stub/loop_lab.cs
      :start-after: Factorial chunk
      :end-before: body
      :dedent: 6    
   
   It is useful to think of the sequence of steps to calculate a 
   concrete example of a factorial, say 6!:    
   
   .. code-block:: none
   
      Start with 1
      2 * 1 = 2
      3 * 2 = 6
      4 * 6 = 24
      5 * 24 = 120
      6 * 120 = 720
   
   **ALSO** find the largest value of ``n`` for which the method works.
   (You might want to add a bit of code further testing Factorial,
   to make this easier.) Caution: although a negative result from the 
   product of two positive numbers is clearly wrong, only half of the
   allowed values are negative, so the first wrong answer could equally well
   be positive. **Explain how you find the largest value of ``n`` that works in this method.**

.. index:: Random; heads or tails exercise
   exercise; heads or tails
   heads or tails exercise
   
.. _head_tails_exercise:

Head or Tails 
---------------

Write a method ``Flip()``,
that will just randomly print ``Heads`` or ``Tails`` *once*.
Accomplish this by choosing 0 or 1 arbitrarily with a random
number generator. More details follow.
 
Use a ``Random`` object, make the ``Random`` object a local variable inside 
the ``Flip`` method.  

*It is generally a good idea to only create a single ``Random`` object
that stays in scope for the whole program so it can be used by various programs. 
One way to do that is to make it *static*. For our purpose here, just place 
the random object declaration in your Flip() method::

  static Random r = new Random();

*Note that in the future you would place the object inside your class but 
outside of any method, so you can use ``r`` in any method in your class*.  

For ``int`` variables ``low`` and ``higher``, with ``low < higher``::
 
    int n = r.Next(low, higher);

returns a (pseudo) random ``int``, satisfying ``low <= n < higher``.
If you select ``low`` and ``higher`` as 0 and 2, 
so there are only two possible values for n,
then you can choose to print ``Heads`` or ``Tails`` with an
|if-else| statement based on the result.

.. warning::

   We have discovered some problems with the ``Next()`` implementation
   that sometimes results in random values not
   being generated. This is likely a bug that will be fixed. If you
   experience any problems with ``Next()``, the following is for you!

.. An alternative to generating random 0 and 1 values for heads and tails
.. is to generate random double-precision values. Using the same
.. variable, ``r``, you can call ``r.NextDouble()`` to get a random value
.. between 0 and 1. You can consider any generated value :math:`n < 0.5` to
.. be heads; :math:`n >= 0.5` represents tails::

..     double n = r.NextDouble();
..     if (n < 0.5) {
..        // heads
..     } else {
..        // tails
..     }
    
In your ``Flip`` method, create a ``for`` loop so you generate a random sequence of 
10 heads and/or tails. 


.. index:: exercise; GroupFlips

Group Flips 
-------------

Write a method ``Flip()``
with the ``static`` ``Random`` declaration 
from the last question. Also include another method::
 
   /// Print out the results from the total number of random flips of a coin.
   /// Group them groupSize per line, each followed by a space.
   /// The last line may contain fewer than groupSize flips 
   /// if total is not a multiple of groupSize.  The last line
   /// should be followed by exactly one newline in all cases.
   /// For example, GroupFlips(10, 4) *could* produce:
   ///   Heads Heads Tails Heads 
   ///   Heads Tails Heads Tails
   ///   Tails Tails 
   static void GroupFlips(int total, int groupSize)

Complete this method definition and test 
with a variety of calls to ``GroupFlips`` in ``Main``.  
The output from the previous exercise would be produced by the call::

    GroupFlips(10, 1);
    
.. index:: exercise; reverse string foreach

.. _reverse-string-foreach:
  
Reverse String ``foreach`` 
---------------------------

We already have discussed :ref:`reverse-string-returned`.
It used a ``for`` loop to go through the characters in
reverse order.  Write a version with the only loop heading::

   foreach(char ch in s) {
   
and no reference to indices in s.


.. index:: exercise; only letters
   only letters exercise; 

.. _only-letters-ex:
  
Only Letters 
----------------------

Write a program that defines and tests a method with
description and heading::

    /// Return s with all non-letters removed.
    /// For example OnlyLetters("Hello, World!") returns "HelloWorld".
    static string OnlyLetters(string s)

Assume the English alphabet.
    
.. index:: exercise; palindrome
   palindrome exercise; 

.. _palindrome-ex:
  
Palindrome Exercise
----------------------

Write a program ``palindrome.cs`` that defines and tests a method with
description and heading::

    /// Return true when s is a palindrome.
    /// For example IsPalindrome("A Toyota!") returns true.
    static bool IsPalindrome(string s)
  
A palindrome is a string that contains the same sequence of letters,
ignoring capitalization, forward and backward.  Non-letters are ignored.
Examples are "Madam, I'm Adam." and "Able was I 'ere I saw Elba."

``IsPalindrome`` can be written very concisely by copying and using
methods from previous exercises.

.. index:: exercise; nested play computer


Predict what these code fragments print.  Then check yourself in csharp::

    for (int i = 3; i > 0; i--) {
        for (int j = i; j < 4; j++) {
            Console.Write(j);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
        
    string s = "abcdef";    
    for (int i = 1; i < s.Length; i += 2) {
        for (int k = 0; k < i; k++) {
            Console.Write(s[i]);
        }
    }

.. index:: exercise; power table

.. _power_table_exercise:

Power Table 
--------------
    
a.  Write a method that completes and tests with this heading. 
    Be sure your program tests 
    with several values for each parameter::

       /// Print a table of powers of positive integers.  
       /// Assume 1 <= nMax <= 12, 1 <= powerMax <= 7. 
       /// Example: output of PowerTable(3, 4)
       ///       n^1       n^2      n^3      n^4
       ///         1         1        1        1
       ///         2         4        8       16
       ///         3         9       27       81     
       ///
       public static void PowerTable(int nMax, int powerMax) 
   
    Make sure the table always ends up with right-justified columns.

b.  Make the table have columns all the same width, but
    make the width be as small as possible for the parameters
    provided, leaving a minimal one space (but not less!) between columns
    somewhere in the table. Consider heading widths, too.




.. #.  Modify the method to return a ``long``.  
..     Then what is the largest value of ``n`` for which the method works?
    
..     *Remember the values from this part and the previous part*
..     *to tell the TA's checking out your work.*

..     .. index:: PrintRectangle
      
.. #.  Complete the method

..     .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/loop_lab_stub/loop_lab.cs
..        :start-after: PrintRectangle chunk
..        :end-before: body
..        :dedent: 6
    
..     Here are further examples::
        
..         PrintRectangle(5, 1, ' ', 'B');
..         PrintRectangle(0, 2, '-', '+');
    
..     would print
    
..     .. code-block:: none

..        BBBBBBB
..        B     B
..        BBBBBBB
..        ++
..        ++
..        ++
..        ++
    
..     Suggestion:  You are always encouraged to build up to a complicated solution 
..     incrementally.
..     You might start by just creating the inner rectangle, without the border.

.. #.  Complete the method below.  

..     .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/loop_lab_stub/loop_lab.cs
..        :start-after: PrintTableBorders chunk
..        :end-before: body
..        :dedent: 6
    
..     Here is further example::
        
..         PrintTableBorders(2, 1, 6, 3);
    
..     would print (with actual vertical bars)
    
..     .. code-block:: none

..        +------+------+
..        |      |      |
..        |      |      |
..        |      |      |
..        +------+------+
    
..     You can do this with lots of nested loops, 
..     or much more simply you can use ``StringOfReps``, possibly six times
..     in several assignment statements, 
..     and print a single string.  Think of larger and larger building blocks.
