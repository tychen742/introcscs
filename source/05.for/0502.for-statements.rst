.. index:: statement; for

The ``for`` Statement 
============================ 

The ``for`` statement executes a statement or a block of statements 
while a specified **Boolean expression** evaluates to true. Such evaluation involves 
comparing the local loop counter variable (an **integer counter** that increments/decrements over every loop) 
to a preset value. Since the number of loops is controlled by comparing the counter with the **preset value**, 
you need to specify the preset value to decide the number of times you want to run the code block when defining 
a ``for`` loop statement.  


For Statement Syntax
----------------------

``for`` loops are usually favored for iteration because the   
all the information about the local loop variable are available in one place at the top, 
which helps quickly visualize the overall sequence in the loop.

The C# for loop statement syntax is:

| ``for (`` *initializer* ``;`` *condition* ; *iterator* ``)`` 
    {
|    // code block (statements)
| ``}``

Let us practice in ``csharprepl``::

   > for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) 
   {                                                                                                                     
         Console.WriteLine(i);                                                                                             
   }

You can see that the ``for`` loop has four parts, a three-section semicolon-separated **header** 
and a **body**:

- **Initializer**: This section is a **variable declaration statement** that 
  declares a ``local loop variable`` (or ``iterator variable`` or the counter) and initialize it with an initial value. 
- **Condition**: The condition section is a **boolean expression** that determines 
  if the next iteration in the loop should be executed or should the loop be terminated. If it evaluates to true, 
  the next iteration is executed; otherwise, the loop is exited. 
- **Iterator**: The iterator (**iteration expression**) section that defines what happens to the counter after each 
  execution of the body of the loop. A common behavior is reassigning 
  (increment or decrement) the value of the counter. 
- The **body** of the loop, which must be a statement or a block of statements.

In the example above, the *initializer* is ``i = 1``, *condition* is ``i <= n``, 
and *iterator* is ``i++`` (see :ref:`arithmetic operators <arithmetic-operators>`).

Note that the initializer section is executed **only once**, before entering the loop. 
Also, the declared variable is local to the ``for`` loop heading and 
the loop body and can not be accessed from outside the for statement. 

The two semicolons are always needed in the ``for`` heading, but any of the
parts they normally separate may be omitted.  
If the condition part is omitted, the condition is 
interpreted as always true, leading to an infinite loop, that can only
terminate due to a ``return`` or :ref:`break statement <break-continue>` in the body.  

**Header variation**

The declaration of a for loop header is flexible. There may be several variables of the
same type initialized, separated by commas. Also, at the end of the ``for`` loop heading, 
the iteration portion may include more than one expression, also separated by commas.  
For example::

      for (int i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i = i+2, j++) {
         Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", i, j);
      }

Guess what this does, and then paste it into csharprepl to check.



.. index:: execution sequence; for loop

Execution sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the execution sequence of for loops, note that the different parts of 
the heading are used at different times:

* When starting the statement, the initialization is done, and then
  the test of condition (boolean expression).
* After finishing the body and returning to the heading, the iteration operations
  are done, followed by the test.

.. _break-continue:

``break`` and ``continue`` Statements
--------------------------------------

The basic syntax of the ``for`` statement is simplistic. Here we are using the 
``break`` and ``continue`` statements to learn the pragmatic coding practice of the ``for`` 
loops by connecting to our understanding of conditional/selection statements. 

When performing iteration, there will be times that you want to alter the code execution 
sequence by skipping part or all of the iterations. If you only want to break out of 
the *enclosing loop*, but *not* out of the whole method or the outer loop (in case of 
nested looping), use a ``break`` statement

  ``break;`` 
  
in place of ``return``, since return will break out the current method. With the ``break`` 
statement, execution continues after terminating the enclosing iteration statement.  

Note that the ``break`` and ``continue`` statements only make practical sense 
inside of an ``if`` statement that is inside the loop. In the following examples, 
you see a ``for`` statement with a ``break`` statement enclosed in a 
``conditional/selection`` statement. 

Assuming that variable ``target`` already has a string value and variable ``arr`` is an array of
strings. With your knowledge about ``arr.Length`` and ``arr[i]`` from :ref:`string`, read 
the following code:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5-9

   bool found = false;    
   
   for (int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++)   // loop for arr.Length times
   {
      if (arr[i] == target)               // if one of arr == targe
      {
         found = true;                    // set found to true
         break;                           // break out of the enclosing loop
      }
   }
    
   if (found)                             // if found == true (from the previous block)
   {
      Console.WriteLine("Target found at index " + i);
   } 
   else 
   {
      Console.WriteLine("Target not found");
   } 

When an element in ``arr`` is reached that matches ``target``, execution breaks out 
of the ``for`` loop and move on to the ``if (found)`` statement block below. 

Now, observe an alternate implementation with a ``compound condition`` (:ref:`Compound-Boolean-Expressions`) in the heading 
and no ``break`` is:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3

    bool found = false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < a.Length && !found; i++) {
       if (a[i] == target) {
          found = true;
       }
    }
    
    if (found) {
       Console.WriteLine("Target found at index " + i);
    } else {
       Console.WriteLine("Target not found");
    } 

As you can see, the code exit because the condition section of the if statement header 
has an expression ``!found`` (:ref:`logical-operators`), meaning found is not true. 
The shows that since ``break`` statements rely on the logic of the conditional statement, 
if the condition can be embedded in the header of the loop, you don't have to use break. 
However, if you are designing a loop that has multiple exit criteria, using break statements 
can make the code much less verbose in the header's condition section, and hence easier to 
follow because the if statement conditions and the immediate break action may be clearly 
presented. 


.. _nested-for-loop:

Nested ``for`` Loop
-----------------------

There will be times when **nested** loops are are required for the problem scenario. 
A nested loop can look like this::

   outer-Loop 
   {
      // body of outer-loop
      inner-Loop
      {
         // body of inner-loop
      }
   ... ... ...
   }

Continuing with our discussion on ``break``, let's say we are in a situation like the following::

   for (....) {
      
      // some statements of outer for loop
      
      for (....) {
         ...
         if (...) {
         ...
         break;
         }
         ...
      }

      // some statements of outer for look
   } 

The break statement is in the inner loop. If it is reached, the inner loop ends,
but the **inner loop** is just a **single statement** inside the outer loop, 
and **the outer loop continues**.  
If the outer loop continuation condition remains true,
the inner loop will be executed again. As an example:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :linenos:

   for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
   {
      for (int j = 0; j <= 3; j++)
      {

         if (i == 2)
         {
            break;
         }

         Console.WriteLine("{0} -- {1}", i, j);
      }
   }

in your tests folder. 


``continue`` Statement

For completeness we mention the much less used ``continue`` statement:

  ``continue;``  

A ``continue`` statement:
- does not break out of the whole loop statement.
- break/skips the execution of the rest of the *body* in the current enclosing loop iteration.
- starts the next enclosing loop iteration. 

In the simplest situations, a ``continue`` statement just avoids an extra ``else`` clause. 
It can considerably shorten code if the test is inside of complicated, deeply nested 
``if`` statements. As an example:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :linenos:

   for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
   {
      for (int j = 0; j <= 3; j++)
      {
         if (i == 2)
         {
              continue;
         }

         Console.WriteLine("{0} -- {1}", i, j);
      }
   }
