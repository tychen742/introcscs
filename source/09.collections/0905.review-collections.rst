Chapter Review 
=========================

#.  Distinguish the cases when you would want to use a list instead of an array, or 
    the other way around.

#.  What syntax is consistent between arrays and lists?  What are comparable
    features, but with different syntax?

#. Here is one way to put five particular elements into a list:

    .. code-block:: 

        var words = new List<string>();
        string[] temp = {"a", "an", "the", "on", "of"};
        foreach(string s in temp) {
            words.Add(s);
        }

    How can you do this all without a loop, and with only two statements? 
    How about with a single statement, assuming you do not need temp again?

#.  If we continue on from above, with the line::

        var words2 = words;
        
    Then what would be the difference in effect between these two possible next
    lines?   ::
    
        words.Clear()
        
        words = new List<string>();     
    
#.  If you delete an element from the middle of a list, what happens to the
    spot where you removed the element?

#.  Which is true for a ``Dictionary``: is it mutable or immutable?
    
#.  What syntax is there for a ``Dictionary`` that matches that for a ``List``?

#. You have been using csharprepl and it shows the following::

    > words
    List<string>(3)
    ┌──────┬──────────┬────────┐
    │ Name │ Value    │ Type   │
    ├──────┼──────────┼────────┤
    │ [0]  │ "Apple"  │ string │
    │ [1]  │ "Banana" │ string │
    │ [2]  │ "Cherry" │ string │
    └──────┴──────────┴────────┘

    What would words.Count return?

#. In VS Code, create a method call SortFruits. When called with a string array 
   argument that contains three fruit names, the method: 
   
   - turns the fruits into a string list, 
   - print out the data type of the list (use .GetType()), 
   - sort the fruits alphabetically, and 
   - iterate through the list and print out the sorted fruit names, but 
   - does not return anything to the caller.


#. In csharprepl, create a dictionary of key-value <string, string>, call it fruits, 
   that contains three fruits and their corresponding color. Iterate through 
   the dictionary and output each entry in one line formatted as "<fruit>" : "<color>". 
   Afterwards, print your full name in a separate line. 



.. #.  Though for some collections, like arrays and lists,
..     you can fairly easily replace a ``foreach`` 
..     loop with a ``for`` loop, that is not the case if you want to iterate
..     through a ``Dictionary``.  How do you go through all the keys in
..     a ``Dictionary``?
.. #.  ``Dictionary`` values are of arbitrary type. What is the restriction on 
..     key types?
