Dictionary
====================

We have explored several ways of storing a collection of the same type of data:

- arrays: built-in syntax, unchanging size of the collection
- List: generic class type, allows the size of the collection to grow

Both approaches allow reference to data elements using a 
numerical index between square brackets, as in ``words[i]``.  
The index provides an order for the elements,
but there is no meaning to the index beyond the sequence order.

Sometimes, we want to look up data based on a more meaningful key, as in a 
dictionary: given a word, you can look up the definition.

C# uses the type name ``Dictionary``, but with greater generality than in
nontechnical use. In a regular dictionary, you start with a word, 
and look up the definition. The generalization is to have some piece of
data that leads you to (or *maps* to) another piece of data.  
The computer science jargon is that a **key** leads you to a **value**.
In a normal dictionary, these are both likely to be strings, but in the
C# generalization, the possible types of key and value are much more extensive.
Hence the generic ``Dictionary`` type requires you to specify 
*both a type for the key and a type for the value*.
    
    
Creating a Dictionary
-----------------------

We can initialize an English-Spanish dictionary ``e2sp`` with ::

    Dictionary<string, string> e2sp = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    
That is quite a mouthful! The C# ``var`` syntax is handy to shorten it::

    var e2sp = new Dictionary<string, string>();

The general generic type syntax therefore is 

   ``Dictionary<`` **keyType**\ ``,`` **valueType** ``>``
   
If you are counting the number of repetitions of words in a document, you are 
likely to want a ``Dictionary`` mapping each word to its number of repetitions so far::

    var wordCount = new Dictionary<string, int>();
    
If your friends all have a personal list of phone numbers, you might look them up
with a dictionary with a string name for the key and a ``List`` of personal phone number
strings for the value.  The type could be ``Dictionary<string, List<string>>``.  
This example illustrates how one generic type can be built on another.

There is no restriction on the value type. There is one important technical 
restriction on the key type: it should be **immutable**. 
.. This has to do with the implementation referenced in :ref:`dictionary-efficiency`.

.. index::
   dictionary; key lookup [ ]
   single: [ ]; dictionary key lookup
   
Similar to an array or ``List``, you can assign and reference elements of 
a ``Dictionary``, using square bracket notation. The difference is that the 
reference is through a key, not a sequential index, as in::

    e2sp["one"] = "uno";
    e2sp["two"] = "dos";
    
csharprepl displays dictionaries in its own special form, 
as a table showing the {key, value} pairs and type. Here is a longer csharprepl sequence:

..  code-block:: none

   > Dictionary<string, string> e2sp = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    
   > e2sp
   Dictionary<string, string>(0)
    
   > e2sp["one"] = "uno";
   > e2sp["two"] = "dos"; 
   > e2sp["three"] = "tres";
   > e2sp.Count
   3   
   > e2sp;                
   Dictionary<string, string>(3)
   ┌──────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
   │ Name │ Value               │ Type                         │
   ├──────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
   │ [0]  │ { "one", "uno" }    │ KeyValuePair<string, string> │
   │ [1]  │ { "two", "dos" }    │ KeyValuePair<string, string> │
   │ [2]  │ { "three", "tres" } │ KeyValuePair<string, string> │
   └──────┴─────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
    
    > Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}; {2}", e2sp["one"], e2sp["two"], e2sp["three"])
         uno, dos; tres

.. index:: dictionary; Keys
   Keys property

If you want to iterate through a whole ``Dictionary``, you will want the syntax below,
with ``foreach`` and the property ``Keys``:

..  code-block:: none

   > foreach (string s in e2sp.Keys) {
   >    Console.WriteLine(s);
   > }
   one
   two
   three
    
The documentation for ``Dictionary`` says
that you cannot depend on the order of processing with ``foreach``, though the present 
implementation remembers the order in which keys were added.


.. index:: example; ContainsKey
   dictionary; ContainsKey example
   ContainsKey example


It is often useful to know if a key is already in a ``Dictionary``:
Note the method ``ContainsKey``:

..  code-block:: none

    > e2sp.ContainsKey("seven")
    false
    > e2sp.ContainsKey("three")
    true

The method Remove takes a key as parameter.  Like a ``List`` and other
collections, a ``Dictionary`` has a ``Clear`` method:

..  code-block:: none

   > e2sp.Count;
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────CompilationErrorException────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ (1,1): error CS0201: Only assignment, call, increment, decrement, await, and new object expressions can be used as a statement │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ e2sp.Count
   > e2sp.Count                
   3
   
   > e2sp.Remove("two")
   true
   > e2sp.Count
   2
   
   > e2sp.Clear
   Action
   > e2sp              
   Dictionary<string, string>(2)
   ┌──────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
   │ Name │ Value               │ Type                         │
   ├──────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
   │ [0]  │ { "one", "uno" }    │ KeyValuePair<string, string> │
   │ [1]  │ { "three", "tres" } │ KeyValuePair<string, string> │
   └──────┴─────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
   
   > e2sp.Clear()
   > e2sp        
   Dictionary<string, string>(0)
   > e2sp.Count
   0

.. .. _sets:

.. Sets
.. --------------------------

.. In the next section we will have an example making central use of a dictionary.
.. It will also make use of a set.  The generic C# version is
.. a ``HashSet``, which models a mathematical set:  a collection
.. with no repetitions and no defined order.  We use a ``HashSet`` for the 
.. words to be ignored.  We use a ``HashSet`` rather than a ``List`` because
.. the ``Contains`` method for a ``List`` has linear order, while the ``Contains`` method for
.. a ``HashSet`` uses the same trick as in a ``Dictionary`` to be of constant order on average.

.. Here is a csharprepl session using the type ``HashSet`` of strings. The ``Add`` method, like 
.. the ``Remove`` method for Lists, returns true or false depending on whether the method 
.. changes the set:

.. ..  code-block:: none

.. 	> var set = new HashSet<string>();
.. 	> set;
.. 	{  }
.. 	> set.Add("hi");
.. 	true
.. 	> set;
.. 	{ "hi" }
.. 	> set.Add("up");         
.. 	true
.. 	> set;
.. 	{ "hi", "up" }
.. 	> set.Add("hi");  // already there       
.. 	false
.. 	> set;
.. 	{ "hi", "up" }
.. 	> set.Contains("hi");
.. 	true
.. 	> set.Contains("down");
.. 	false
.. 	> var set2 = new HashSet<string>(new string[]{"a", "be", "see"});
.. 	> set2;
.. 	{ "a", "be", "see" }

.. That lack of order for a ``HashSet`` means it cannot
.. be indexed, but otherwise it has mostly the same methods and constructors 
.. that have been discussed for a ``List``, including ``Add`` and ``Contains`` and 
.. a constructor that takes a collection as parameter.  


.. .. index:: example; Word Count
..    Word Count example

.. Word Count Example
.. -------------------

.. Counting the number of repetitions of words in a text provides a realistic
.. example of using a ``Dictionary``.  With each word that you find, you want to associate
.. a number of repetitions.  A complete program is in the example file 
.. :repsrc:`count_words/count_words.cs`. 

.. The central functions are excerpted below, and they also introduce some extra 
.. features from the .Net libraries.

.. This constructor pattern taking the elements of one collection and creating another
.. collection, possibly of another type, is used twice: first
.. to create a ``HashSet`` from an array, and later to create a ``List`` from a ``HashSet``.  
.. The latter is needed so the ``List`` can be sorted in alphabetical order with its 
.. ``Sort`` method, used here for the first time.  Our table contains the words in
.. alphabetical order.

.. Also used for the first time are two string methods: the pretty clearly named ``ToCharArray`` and
.. another variation on ``Split``.  An alternative to supplying a single character to split on,
.. is to use a ``char`` array as parameter, and the string is split at an occurrence of any of the
.. characters in the array.  This allows a split on all punctuation and special symbol characters,
.. as well as a blank.

.. We separate the processing into two functions, one calculating the dictionary, and one printing
.. a table.  To reduce the amount of clutter in the ``Dictionary``, the function
.. ``GetCounts`` takes as a parameter a set of words to ignore.

.. .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/count_words/count_words.cs
..    :start-after: chunk
..    :end-before: chunk

.. Look at the code carefully, and look at the whole program that analyses the
.. Gettysburg Address.

.. Dictionary Efficiency
.. --------------------------

.. We could simulate the effect of a Dictionary pretty easily by keeping
.. a List ``keys`` and a List ``values``, in the same order.  We could
.. find the entry with a specified key with::

..    int i = keys.IndexOf(key);
..    return values[i];
   
.. Searching though a ``List``, however, take time proportional to the
.. length of the ``List`` in general, *linear order*.  Through a clever implementation
.. covered in data structures classes, a ``Dictionary`` uses a *hash table*
.. to make the average lookup time of *constant order*.  A hash table depends on the
.. keys being immutable.
