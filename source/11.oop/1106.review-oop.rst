#. What is the relationship between "student1" and class Student in the following code? 
  .. code-block:: csharp
  :linenos  
  using System;
  public class Student {

    private string studentName;   
    private int studentAge; 

    public string Name             
    {
        get { return studentName; }
        set { studentName = value; } 

    public int Age 
    {
        get { return studentAge; }
        set { studentAge = value; }
    }
  
  public class GFG {
    static public void Main()
    {
        Student student1 = new Student();
        // Student student2 = new Student();
        // Student student3 = new Student();
        student1.name = "Doris";
        Console.WriteLine("student1.name: " + student1.name);
    }
  }

#. In the preceding code, if you uncomment student2 and student3, will the code 
   execute without error?

#. In the preceding code, if the content of the Main method is changed to the following, 
   what would the output be?

  .. code-block:: csharp

    Student obj = new Student();
    obj.Name = "TY Chen";
    obj.Age = 35;
    Console.WriteLine(" Name : " + obj.Name);
    Console.WriteLine(" Age : " + obj.Age); 

#. Perform the following tasks:
   #. Inherit from the following abstract class Shape to create two derived classes: Triangle and Rectangle. 
   #. Implement the method so that Triangle and Rectangle are able to calculate the areas respectively. 
   #. Prepare the three classes in a file called Shape.cs and run the code from the method in Program.cs. 
   #. Note that in the derived classes you may need to design fields in addition to implementing the method. 

   
  .. code-block:: csharp  
      public abstract class Shape
      {
          public abstract double GetArea();
      }
