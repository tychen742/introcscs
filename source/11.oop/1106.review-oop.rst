Lab & Review Questions
========================

- Follow the lab instructions as seen in, e.g., Chapter 10 to prepare this lab.
- Name this lab Ch11OOPLab. 

#. What is the relationship between "student1" and class Student in the following code? 
  
  .. code-block:: csharp
    :linenos:

    using System;
    public class Student {
  
      private string studentName;   
      private int studentAge; 
  
      public string Name             
      {
          get { return studentName; }
          set { studentName = value; } 
      }
      public int Age 
      {
          get { return studentAge; }
          set { studentAge = value; }
      }
    }
    
    public class GFG {
      static public void Main()
      {
          Student student1 = new Student();
          // Student student2 = new Student();
          // Student student3 = new Student();
          student1.name = "Doris";
          Console.WriteLine("student1.name: " + student1.name);
      }
    }

2. In the preceding code, if you uncomment student2 and student3, will the code 
   execute without error?

#. In the preceding code, if the content of the Main method is changed to the following, 
   what would the output be?

  .. code-block:: csharp

    Student obj = new Student();
    obj.Name = "TY Chen";
    obj.Age = 35;
    Console.WriteLine(" Name : " + obj.Name);
    Console.WriteLine(" Age : " + obj.Age); 

4. Perform the following tasks:
   
   #. Inherit from the following abstract class Shape to create two derived classes: Triangle and Rectangle. 
   #. Implement the method so that Triangle and Rectangle are able to calculate the areas respectively. 
   #. Prepare the three classes in a file called Shape.cs and run the code from the method in Program.cs. 
   #. Note that in the derived classes you may need to design fields in addition to implementing the method. 
   
  .. code-block:: csharp  

    public abstract class Shape
    {
        public abstract double GetArea();
    }
