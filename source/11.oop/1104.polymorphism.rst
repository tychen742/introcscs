Polymorphism
================

Polymorphism means "many-shaped", and it occurs when we 
have classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Polymorphism refers to the 
ability of a single interface to be used to refer to multiple **implementations** of 
a particular behavior (functionality or "method"). 

In C#, polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance, interfaces, and ``virtual`` 
methods. Inheritance allows us inheriting fields and methods from a base/parent class. 
Polymorphism further allows use to modify and use those methods to perform different 
tasks. This is called ``method overriding``, meaning to override the definition of the 
method in the base/parent class. In this case here, you are implementing method name 
that you inherit from a parent class, you have to use the ``same method signatures``.

There will be time when you need to define two or more methods sharing the same 
method name in the same class (as opposing to method overriding, where method modification 
happens in the child classes). For example, you want to create an "AddTwo" method in your 
math operation class and you want AddTwo to intake integers, float, and decimal types. 
This is a form of polymorphism [#polymorphism-definition]_ called **method overloading**, 
in which you need to provide ``different method signatures`` (such as data types) in 
order to distinguish the methods. 


Method Overriding: virtual/override/base
-----------------------------------------

Think of a base class called ``Animal`` that has a method called 
``animalSound()``. Derived classes of Animals could be ``Pig``, ``Cat``, ``Dog`` 
- and they can have their own implementation of the same ``animalSound()`` 
(the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):

.. code-block:: 
    :linenos:

    class Animal                // Base class (parent) 
    {
        public void animalSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
        }
    }

    class Pig : Animal          // Derived class (child) 
    {
        public void animalSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
        }
    }
    class Dog : Animal          // Derived class (child) 
    {
        public void animalSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow wow");
        }
    }
    class Program 
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        {
            Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Create a Animal object
            Animal myPig = new Pig();       // Create a Pig object
            Animal myDog = new Dog();       // Create a Dog object            
            myAnimal.animalSound();         // The animal makes a sound
            myPig.animalSound();            // The animal makes a sound
            myDog.animalSound();            // The animal makes a sound
            myCat.animalSound();            // The animal makes a sound
        }
    }    

The code output above is not what you expected. Different animals should make different 
sounds, but here Pig and Dog are making the same sound. This happens because the 
base class method overrides the derived class method, when they share the same name.

For the derived (child) to ``override`` the base class method, you need to 

#. add the ``virtual`` keyword to the method in the base class; and 
#. use the ``override`` keyword for each derived class methods. 


.. code-block:: csharp
    :linenos:

    class Animal                            // Base class (parent) 
    {
        public virtual void animalSound()   // virtual
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
        }
    }

    class Pig : Animal                      // Derived class (child) 
    {
        public override void animalSound()  // override
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
        }
    }

    class Dog : Animal                      // Derived class (child) 
    {
        public override void animalSound()  // override
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow wow");
        }
    }

    class Cat : Animal                      // Derived class (child) 
    {
        public void animalSound()
        {
            animalSound();
            // or base.animalSound();       // the base keyword refer
        }
    }


    class Program 
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        {
            Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Create a Animal object
            Animal myPig = new Pig();       // Create a Pig object
            Animal myDog = new Dog();       // Create a Dog object
            Animal myDog = new Cat();       // Create a Cat object

            myAnimal.animalSound();         // The animal makes a sound
            myPig.animalSound();            // The pig says: wee wee
            myDog.animalSound();            // The dog says: bow wow
            myCat.animalSound();            // The animal makes a sound
        }
    }

Now you have achieved **method overriding** by marking the method in the base class 
``virtual`` and the method in the derived class ``override``.


.. note:: 

    The content in this section discuss advanced scenarios and is here for your reference. 


In C#, there are a few rules to follow when using polymorphism: [#polymorphism-codewithhonor]_

#. A class can *only inherit from a single base class*, but it can implement multiple 
   interfaces.
#. A method marked as ``virtual`` in the base class can be overridden in a derived 
   class using the ``override`` keyword.
#. If a derived class wants to call the implementation of a virtual method from 
   the base class, it can use the ``base`` keyword.
#. If a derived class wants to prevent a virtual method from being overridden 
   in further derived classes, it can use the ``sealed`` keyword.
#. If a derived class wants to provide its own implementation of a virtual method, 
   but also wants to call the implementation from the base class, it can use 
   the ``base`` keyword in the implementation.

.. code-block:: csharp
    :linenos:

    public class Shape
    {
        public virtual void Draw()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape");
        }
    }

    public class Circle : Shape
    {
        public override void Draw()
        {
            base.Draw();                    // Call the implementation in the base class
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
        }
    }

    public class Rectangle : Shape
    {
        public sealed override void Draw()  // note the "sealed" keyword
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle");
        }
    }

    public class Triangle : Shape
    {
        public override void Draw()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a triangle");
        }
    }

    public class Square : Rectangle
    {
        // This will cause a compile-error because the Draw method is sealed in the Rectangle class
        public override void Draw()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a square");
        }
    }


Method Overloading
--------------------
    
With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different 
signatures/parameters. 

For example, consider the following example, which your use two methods that add numbers 
of different data types: [#method-overloading-w3]_

.. code-block:: csharp

    static int PlusMethodInt(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
    
    static double PlusMethodDouble(double x, double y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
    
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int myNum1 = PlusMethodInt(8, 5);
        double myNum2 = PlusMethodDouble(4.3, 6.26);
        Console.WriteLine("Int: " + myNum1);
        Console.WriteLine("Double: " + myNum2);
    }

Obviously you are performing the same operations in the preceding code, with the only 
difference been the data types. So, instead of creating two different methods, you may 
``overload`` a ``PlusMethod`` method to work for both int and double:

.. code-block:: csharp
    
    static int PlusMethod(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
    
    static double PlusMethod(double x, double y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
    
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int myNum1 = PlusMethod(8, 5);
        double myNum2 = PlusMethod(4.3, 6.26);
        Console.WriteLine("Int: " + myNum1);
        Console.WriteLine("Double: " + myNum2);
    }

Now, with **method overloading**, you can call ``PlusMethod()`` with different data 
types (int or double) and C# will choose the correct method to run according to their 
signatures even if both methods have the same name. 

Another example below shows you that, in addition to data types, you may even change the 
number of parameters or even the operators (the ``+`` in the fourth ``Add()`` method 
means). 

.. code-block:: csharp

    namespace IntroCSCS
    {
        class MethodOverLoading
        {
            public int Add(int num1, int num2)
            {
                return (num1 + num2);
            }
            public int Add(int num1, int num2, int num3)
            {
                return (num1 + num2 + num3);
            }
            public float Add(float num1, float num2)
            {
                return (num1 + num2);
            }
            public string Add(string value1, string value2)
            {
                return (value1 + " " + value2);
            }
        }
    }

    namespace IntroCSCS
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {    
                MethodOverloading mol = new MethodOverloading();  
                Console.WriteLine("Add two int parameter: " + mol.Add(3, 2));  
                Console.WriteLine("Add three int parameter: " + mol.Add(3, 2, 8));  
                Console.WriteLine("Add two float parameter: " + mol.Add(3f, 22f));  
                Console.WriteLine("Add two string parameter: " + mol.Add("hello", "world"));             }

                // output: 
                // Add two int parameter: 5
                // Add three int parameter: 13
                // Add two float parameter: 25
                // Add two string parameter: hello world
        }
    }

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#polymorphism-definition] There is no globally agreed-upon definition of "Polymorphism". 
   Microsoft's discussion on `polymorphism <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/polymorphism>`_ 
   does not include method overloading. It is common to categorize polymorphism into 1) 
   compile time polymorphism, including method overloading and operator overloading, and 2) 
   runtime polymorphism, as achieved by method overriding. For example, see `here <https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/polymorphism>`_, 
   while it's easier to say that method overloading and method overriding as two major types 
   of polymorphism such as `here <https://ogutdgnn.medium.com/polymorphism-in-c-with-method-overloading-and-method-overriding-da0d5323a2cd#:~:text=Overloading%20is%20determined%20at%20compile,same%20method%20in%20inherited%20classes.>`_.
