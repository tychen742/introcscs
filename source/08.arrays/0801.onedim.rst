One Dimensional Arrays
============================ 

.. index::
   array; [ ] declaration

An array is a ``data structure`` that contains a number of variables that are accessed 
through computed indices. The variables contained in an array, also called the 
``elements`` of the array, are all of the same type, and this type is called the 
``element type`` of the array. [#arr-microsoft]_

In C#, an array is a structure representing a **fixed length** ``ordered`` collection of 
values or objects with the **same type**. Arrays make it easier to organize and 
operate on large amounts of data. For example, rather than creating 100 integer 
variables, you can just create one array that stores all those integers and access 
them using array indices. [#arr-codeacademy]_

You have learned that a string is an immutable ``sequence`` of characters and how to 
loop through the sequence. Arrays provide more general sequences, with the 
same indexing notation, but with free choice of the ``type`` of the items in the 
sequence, and the ability to ``change`` the elements in the sequence.


Creating Arrays
-----------------

A C# ``array variable`` is declared similarly to a non-array variable, with the 
addition of square brackets (``[]``) after the ``type`` specifier to denote it as an array. 
So, the general form for declaring an array variable of the element type is:

    **type**\ ``[]`` variableName;

For example, if you want to create an array called ``a`` with the type ``int`` 
for elements, you declare the array variable as::

   int[] a;

In this declaration, you do *not* know how many elements will be in this array 
from the preceding declaration. You must give further information to create the 
corresponding ``array object``. A new object can be created using the ``new`` 
syntax. An array must get a definite length, which can be a literal integer or 
any integer expression. The general syntax to create a  new array is

   ``new`` **type**\ ``[`` *length* ``]``
   
After the type, there are square brackets enclosing an expression for the length
of the array - this length is unchangeable after creation. For example ::

   int[] a;
   a = new int[4];
   
or, you may combine with the declaration, ::

   int[] a = new int[4];

to creates an array that holds 4 integers. After specifying the number of the elements
of the array, the default initial values are also assigned. For example, numerical 
arrays get initialized to all 0's (false for boolean, the character with Unicode 
number zero for char, and null for objects and string) with this syntax by default, so when you loop 
through the array variable::

   > foreach (int i in a)      
     {                                                
         Console.Write(i);                            
     }                                                
   0000
   > 

An **array initializer** consists of a sequence of variable initializers, 
enclosed by "``{``” and "``}``" tokens and separated by "``,``" tokens. 
An array initializer can be used in a variable declaration::

   int[] a = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};

which is a shorthand for the equivalent ``array creation expression``::

   int[] a = new int[] {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};


Note that the actual data for an array is *not* stored directly in the memory location 
allocated by the declaration. The array could have any number of items, and hence 
the memory requirements are not known at compile time. Like all other object 
(as opposed to primitive) types, what is actually stored at the memory location declared 
for ``a`` is a *reference* to the actual place where the data for the array is stored. 
In actual compiler implementation, this reference is an address in memory. In the diagram 
below, you see the object references with an arrow *pointing* to the actual location 
for the object's data after ``a`` is initialized:

.. image:: ../images/newArray1.png
   :alt: new array
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt
 
The small box beside ``a`` is meant to indicate the memory space allocated when ``a`` is
declared. As you can see that space does not actually contain the array, but rather a 
*reference* to the array, pointing to the actual sequence of data for the array.
Also, in the diagram you see the indices associated with each element, though they 
are not actual a part of what is stored in memory.



Accessing Array Elements
--------------------------


.. index::
   single: [ ]; array indexing
   array; indexing [ ]
   index; array
   
The elements inside an array can to referenced with the same index notation used
earlier for strings. :: 

    a[2]
    
refers to the element at index 2 (third element because of 0 based indexing).

Unlike with strings, this element can not only be read, but also be assigned to::

    a[0] = 7;
    a[1] = 5;
    a[2] = 9;
    a[3] = 6;

These four assignment statements 
would replace the original 0 values for each element in the array.

This is a verbose way to specify all array values. An array with the
same final data could be created with the single declaration::

   int[] b = {7, 5, 9, 6};

.. image:: ../images/newArray2.png
   :alt: new array initialized with braces
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

The list in braces ONLY is allowed as an initialization of a variable
in a *declaration*, not in a later assignment statement.  
Technically it is an initializer, not an array literal.

Individual array elements can *both* be used in expressions, and be assigned to. 
Continuing with the earlier example code::

    a[2] = 4*a[1] - a[3];

``a[2]`` now equals 4\*5 - 6 = 14.

Arrays, like strings, have a ``Length`` property::

    Console.WriteLine(b.Length); // prints 4

just like with strings. In practice array elements are almost always referred 
to with an index variable. A very common pattern is to deal with each element 
in sequence, and the syntax is the same as for a string. Print all elements 
of array ``b``::

    for (int i= 0; i < b.Length, i++) { 
       Console.WriteLine(b[i]); 
    }
    
The ``foreach`` syntax would be::

   foreach ( int x in b) {
      Console.WriteLine(x);
   }

while the ``while`` loop syntax would be::

   > int[] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; 
   > int i = 0;                
   > while ( i < a.Length){ 
      Console.Write(a[i]); 
      i++; 
     }
   12345
   > 

In the ``foreach`` loop, the ``int`` type for ``x`` matches the element type of the array ``b``.

The shorter ``foreach`` syntax is not as general as the ``for`` syntax.  
For example, to print only the first *3* elements of b::

   for(int i= 0; i < 3; i++) {
      Console.WriteLine(b[i]);
   }

but the ``foreach`` syntax would not work, since it must process *all* elements.

Also, you may use the ``for`` syntax to assign new values to the array elements, 
rather than just use the values in expressions::

   for(int i= 0; i < b.Length; i++) {
      b[i] = 5*i;
   }
   
Now the array ``b`` of our earlier examples (of length 4) would now contain 0, 5,
10, and 15.  

.. warning::
   There is no analog of *changing* the value of ``b[i]`` with a
   ``foreach`` loop.  To change values in an array, we must
   assign to each location in the array by *index*.
   A ``foreach`` loop only provides the *value* of each sequence element
   for us to read.

We have had the array indices so far be given by a single symbol, 
which is the most common case in practice, but in fact what appears
inside the square braces can be any ``int`` *expression*.
Like parentheses, square brackets *delimit*
the inside expression, which gets evaluated first, before the array value is
looked up. Consider this csharprepl sequence:

..  code-block:: none

   > int[] a = {5, 9, 15, -4};
   > int i = 2;
   > a[i];
   15

This should be clear. Now think first, what should ``a[i+1]`` be?

..  code-block:: none

   > a[i+1];
   -4

In steps:  ``a[i+1]`` is ``a[2+1]`` is ``a[3]`` is -4. Be careful,
``a[i+1]`` is *NOT* ``a[i] + 1`` (which would be 16). 


.. index:: array; as parameter
   example; PrintStrings

.. _printstrings:

The code above to print each element of an array performs a 
unified and possibly useful operation, so it would make sense to
encapsulate it into a function. A function can take any type as a
parameter, so an array type is perfectly reasonable! Above we
printed each element of an array of integers. This time let's choose strings,
so the formal parameter is an array of strings:  ``string[]``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/string_array/string_array.cs
   :start-after: chunk PrintStrings
   :end-before: chunk
   :linenos:
   :dedent: 6

With this definition, the code fragment  ::

     string[] hamlet = {"To be", "or not", "to be!"};
     PrintStrings(hamlet);
     
would print:

..  code-block:: none

    To be
    or not
    to be!

Here we are just reading the data from the array parameter.  
We will see that there are more wrinkles to array parameters in :ref:`alias`.

.. index:: function; return array
   array; returned by method
  
An array type can also be
returned like any other type.  Examine the function definition:
  
.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/string_array/string_array.cs
   :start-after: chunk InputNStrings
   :end-before: chunk
   :dedent: 6

This code follows a standard pattern for functions returning an array:
  
* In order to return an array, we must *first create* a new array
  with the ``new`` syntax.  We must set the proper length (``n`` here).  
* And we are not done with one line of creation:  Since the array has 
  multiple parts, we need a loop to assign all the values.  We have a simple
  ``for`` loop to assign to each element in turn.
* Finally we must return the array that we created!



.. index::
   command line; parameter
   parameter; command line to Main
   Main; parameters

.. _command-line-param:

Parameters to Main
---------------------

The ``Main`` function may take an array of strings as parameter, as in example 
:repsrc:`print_param/print_param.cs`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/print_param/print_param.cs
   :start-after: chunk
   :end-before: chunk
   :dedent: 3


By convention, the formal parameter for ``Main`` is called ``args``, 
short for arguments.  

Compile and run the program from the command line.
Run it again with some things at the end of the line like:

..   code-block:: none

     [username]@[computer]:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch08Arrays$ dotnet run hi there 123

This should print for you:

..  code-block:: none

    There are 3 command line parameters.
    hi
    there
    123

See what quoted strings do.  Use command line parameters (with the quotes)  
``"hi there" 123``.
This should print for you::

    There are 2 command line parameters.
    hi there
    123



.. _command-line-adder-exercise:

Command Line Adder Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a code block in the Main method of your project that calculates and prints 
the sum of three command line parameters taken from user input:: 

   2 5 22

then the program prints 29.

Going down to your project's bin/Debug/net8.0 directory from the command line, you will 
find the executables (the ``.dll`` or ``.exe`` files) that you can execute. In 
``Windows``, it should look like::
    
   PS C:\Users\[username]\workspace\introcscs\Ch08Arrays\bin\Debug\net8.0> Ch08Arrays.exe 2 5 22
    
and you will see the output. You can also run the project by issuing::
   
   PS C:\Users\[username]\workspace\introcscs\Ch08Arrays> dotnet run 2 5 22

and you will see the same output. In macOS, you run this with ``dotnet run`` in your 
project folder at command line with the arguments::

   [username]@[computer]:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch08Arrays$ dotnet run 2 5 22

or in more current version of macOS:: 

   [username]@[computer]:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch08Arrays/bin/Debug/net8.0$ dotnet Ch08Arrays.dll 2 5 22
   
and you will see the output of the sum of the integers.

This shows that the ``string[] args`` in the Main method is a ``string array`` taking its 
elements from the command line when the project is executed in the command line with 
arguments provided.
 

.. index:: string; Split
   Split method for strings
   
.. _Split:

.. String Method Split
.. ---------------------

.. A string method producing an array:

.. ``string[] Split(char`` **separator** ``)``   
..     Returns an array of substrings from *this* string.  They are the pieces left
..     after chopping out the separator character from the string. 
..     A piece may be the empty string. 
..     Example: 

..     ..  code-block:: none
    
.. 		> var fruitString = "apple pear banana";
.. 		> string[] fruit = fruitString.Split(' ');
.. 		> fruit;
.. 		{ "apple", "pear", "banana" }
.. 		> fruit[1];
.. 		"pear"
.. 		> var s = "  extra   spaces ";
.. 		> s.Split(' ');
.. 		{ "", "", "extra", "", "", "spaces", "" }
		
.. Note: The response with the list in braces is a purely *csharprepl* convention for displaying
.. sequences for the user.  There is no corresponding string displayed by C# Write commands.
.. Also see that the string is split at *each* ``separator``, 
.. even if that produces empty strings.

.. .. index:: IntsFromString1
..    index; parallel arrays

.. .. _ints_from_string1:

.. ``Split`` is useful for parsing a line with several parts.  You might get a group of 
.. integers on a line of text, for instance from::

..          string input = UI.PromptLine(
..             "Please enter some integers, separated by single spaces: ");

.. To extract the numbers, you want to the separate the entries in the string
.. with ``Split``, *and* you probably want further processing: 
.. If you want them as integers, not strings, you must convert each one separately.

.. It is useful to put this idea in a function.
.. See the type returned.  It is an array ``int[]`` for the int results::

..       /// Return ints taken from space separated integers in a string.
..       public static int[] IntsFromString1(string input)
..       {
..          string[] integers = input.Split(' ');
..          int[] data = new int[integers.Length];
..          for (int i=0; i < data.Length; i++)
..             data[i] = int.Parse(integers[i]);
..          return data;
..       }
      
.. In a call to ``IntsFromString1("2 5 22")``,  ``integers`` would be 
.. an array containing strings ``"2"``, ``"5"``, and ``"22"``.  
.. We need the conversions to ``int`` to go in a new array that we call ``data``.
.. We must set its length, which will clearly be the same as for ``integers``,
.. ``integers.Length``.
.. To assign elements into ``data`` we need a loop providing indices,
.. like the ``for`` loop provided.  Then for each index, we parse a
.. string in ``integers`` into an ``int``, 
.. and place the ``int`` in the corresponding location in ``data``.  We need to return
.. ``data`` at the end to make it accessible to the caller.

.. Again we use the basic pattern for returning an array.  

.. Dealing with arrays is hard for many students for several reasons:

.. *  You have new array declaration and creation syntax.
.. *  Array are compound objects, so there is a lot to think about.
.. *  Loops are hard for many people, and you almost always deal with loops.
.. *  You usually must deal with index variables, and there are many 
..    patterns.

.. The last point is significant, 
.. so it is important to note the special pattern in the example above:

.. .. note::
..    The use of the same index variable for more than one array is 
..    a standard way to have 
..    *related* entries in *corresponding* positions in the arrays.

.. We will introduce a refinement of this function in the
.. :ref:`intsfromstring_exercise`.  It will rely on a more complicated
.. index-handling pattern.


  
.. index:: alias

.. _alias:

References and Aliases
-------------------------

Object variables, like arrays, are references, 
and this has important implications for
assignment.

With a primitive type like an ``int``, an assignment copies the data:

.. image:: ../images/intCopy.png
   :alt: copying an int
   :align: center
   :width: 90 pt

In the diagram, the contents of the memory box labeled ``b`` is copied to the
memory box labeled ``d``. The value of ``d`` starts off equal to the value of ``b``, 
but can later be changed independently.

Contrast an assignment with arrays.  The value that is copied is the *reference*,
not the array data itself, so both end up pointing at the *same*  actual array:

.. image:: ../images/arrayAlias.png
   :alt: copying an array reference
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt
   
Hereafter, array assignments like::

   b[2] = -10;
   d[1] = 55;
   
would both change the *same* array.  Now ``b`` and ``d`` are essentially
names for the same thing (the actual array).  The technical term matches English:
The names are *aliases*.

This may seem like a pretty silly discussion. Why bother to give two different 
names to the same object? Isn't one enough? In fact it is very important
in function/method calls. An array reference can be passed as an actual value, 
and it is the array *reference* that is copied to the formal parameter, so
the formal parameter name is an **alias** for the actual parameter name.

.. note::
   If an array passed as a parameter to a method has elements changed in the
   method, then the change affects the actual parameter array.
   The change *remains* in the actual parameter array *after* 
   the method has terminated.

.. index:: example; Scale
   Scale example
   array; parameter

For example, consider the following function::

   // Modify a by multiplying all elements by multiplier. 
   static void Scale(int[] a, int multiplier)
   {
      for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i++) {
         a[i] *= multiplier;  // or:  a[i] = a[i] * multiplier
      }
   }
   
The fragment::

   int[] nums = {2, 4, 1};
   Scale(nums, 5);
   
would *change* nums, so it ends up containing elements 10, 20, and 5.



    
.. index:: OOP; default value
   default value in instance 

.. _default-fields:
   
Default Initializations
-------------------------

Did you notice that when the first example array of integers was created,   
it was filled with zeros?  It is a safety feature of C# that the internal fields 
of objects always get a specific value, not random data.  Here are the defaults:

.. csv-table:: Default Values
    :header: "Type", "Value"
    :widths: 30, 10

    "primitive numeric types", "0"
    "bool", "false"
    "all object types", "null"

.. warning::

   An array with elements of object type, like ``string[]``,  
   without a specific initializer, 
   gets initialized to  all ``null`` values.  The creation is totally
   legal, but if you try to use the created value, like  ::
   
       string[] words = new string[10];
       Console.WriteLine(words[0].Length);  // run time error here 
    
   The error is because ``null`` is not an object - it does not have a ``Length``
   property.  If, for example, 
   you want an array of empty strings you would need to initialize it with
   a loop::
    
       string[] words = new string[10];
       for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++) {
          words[i] = "";
       }


LINQ Methods
--------------

.. note:: 

   Language-Integrated Query (`LINQ <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/>`_) is the name for a set of technologies based 
   on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. 

All the arrays in C# are derived from an abstract base class `System.Array <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array?view=netframework-4.7.2>`_. 
The Array class implements the ``IEnumerable interface``, so you can LINQ 
extension methods such as Max( ), Min( ), Sum( ), reverse( ), etc on arrays::

   int[] nums = new int[5]{ 10, 15, 16, 8, 6 };

   nums.Max();       // returns 16
   nums.Min();       // returns 6
   nums.Sum();       // returns 55
   nums.Average();   // returns 55
