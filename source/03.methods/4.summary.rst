Static Method Summary
==============================

This chapter has introduced static methods:  those used in procedural programming
as opposed to :ref:`instance-methods` used to 
implement object-oriented programming.

   ( ); method definition


Method definition
-------------------

#. The general syntax for defining a static method is

   | ``static`` **returnTypeOrVoid** **MethodName** ``(``  parameter list ``)``
   | ``{``
   |    statements in the method body...
   | ``}``
       
#. The *formal parameter list* can be empty or contain one or more comma separated 
   *formal parameter* entries.   
   Each formal parameter entry has the form
 
      **type** **parameterName**
      
#. If the method is going to be called from outside its class, the heading needs
   to start with ``public`` before the ``static``. 
   
#. If **returnTypeOrVoid** in the heading is not ``void``, there must be a 
   *return statement* in the method body.  A return statement has the form

    ``return`` *expression* ``;``
    
   where the expression should be of the same type as in **returnTypeOrVoid**.
   Execution of the method terminates immediately when a return statement
   is reached.  
   
#. Execution of a program starts at a method with a heading including

     ``static void Main``
   


   
Method Calls
---------------

#.  A method call takes the form

    **MethodName** ``(``  actual parameter list ``)``
    
    A method call makes the method definition be *executed*.
    
#.  The actual parameter list is a comma separated list of the *same*
    length as the formal parameter list.  Each entry is an expression.
    The entries in an actual parameter list do *not* include type declarations.
    
    Effectively, the method execution starts by assigning to each
    formal parameter variable the corresponding value from 
    evaluating the actual parameter expression.
    In particular, that means the actual parameter values must be allowed
    in an assignment statement for a variable of the formal parameter's type!

    
#.  If the method has return type ``void``, it can only be used syntactically
    as an entire statement (with a semicolon added). After the method
    call completes, execution continues with the next statement.
    
#.  If there is a non-void return type, then the method call is syntactically
    an expression in the statement where is appears.
    The execution of such a method must reach a return statement.  The value
    of the method-call expression is the value of the expression in this
    return statement.
    
    
#.  A method with a return value can also legally be used as a whole statement.
    In this case the return value is lost.  Though legal, this is often an error! 
    
    
Scope
------

#.  A variable declared inside a method definition is called a *local variable*.
    This declaration may be in either the formal parameter
    list or in the body of the method.  
    
#.  A local variable comes into existence after the method is called, and ceases
    to exist after that method call terminates.  A local variable is invisible
    to the rest of the program.  Its *scope* is just within that method.  Its
    lifetime is just through a single
    method call.  Its *value* may be transferred outside of the method scope
    by standard means, principally:  
    
    - If it is the expression in a return statement, its value is
      sent back to the caller.
    - It can be passed as an
      actual parameter to a further method called within its scope.
      

    
Static Variables
----------------

#.  There may be a declaration prefaced by the word ``static`` that appears 
    *inside* a class and *outside* of any method definition in the class.
    Static variables are visible within each method of the class, and may
    be used by the methods.  
    
#.  A common use of a static variable is to give a name to a constant 
    value used in multiple methods in the class.
