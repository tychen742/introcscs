Lab: Unit Test
==================

Your Tasks
------------

#. Implement this unit testing project.
#. Add one method in the application and one corresponding test in the test project. 
#. As usual, prepare the assignment using a Word document with screenshots (code and execution with path 
   and username) and your annotations. 

Preparing Project
------------------

The idea of TDD is to write tests first, so that you will be focused with the requirements and not 
to be distracted by your own coding. That's why we start with simple test cases in the test project to test the 
units in the application project. After you make sure the application tests can pass, you then improve the 
units (methods, classes) in the application project. 


The process of creating a unit test involves several steps. Most, if not all, of the steps can be performed 
in VS Code but it can be easier from time to time with the terminal:

#. Create a lab folder, call it ``Ch13SelectedTopicsLab``. Its location is inside [USERNAME]\\workspace\\introcscs\\. 

#. Create a solution folder:
   
   #. Inside your Ch13SelectedTopicsLab, create a folder, call it UnitTestProject1 (``mkdir UnitTestProject1``).

    To make this folder a solution, run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        tychen@mac:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch13SelectedTopicsLab/UnitTestProject1$ dotnet new sln
        The template "Solution File" was created successfully.

   2. Later, when you need to choose a solution for the active project, go to ``View`` ==> ``Command Palette`` ==> type solution and 
      choose ``.NET: Open Solution`` to choose your solution, which is UnitTestProject1 in this case. 

#. Create an **application project** folder (new here but can be existing), call it ``MathApp``, and 
   
   a **test project** folder, call it ``MathAppTest``:

   #. ``mkdir MathApp`` inside UnitTestProject1.
   #. ``mkdir MathAppTest`` inside UnitTestProject1.

   Now if you ``ls``, you should see both folders.

#. Make MathApp a console app project and MathAppTest a MSTest project:

   #. Inside the MathApp folder, do ``dotnet new console``.
   #. Inside the MathAppTest folder, do ``dotnet new mstest`` (we are using MSTest here but you can use other tools such as NUnit or xUnit).
   
#. Add both projects to solution:

   1. Add MathApp to solution:
    
    .. code-block:: bash        

        tychen@mac:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch13SelectedTopicsLab/UnitTestProject1$ dotnet sln add MathApp
        Project `MathApp/MathApp.csproj` added to the solution.

   2. Add MathAppTest to solution:

    .. code-block:: bash      

        tychen@mac:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch13SelectedTopicsLab/UnitTestProject1$ dotnet sln add MathAppTest/
        Project `MathAppTest/MathAppTest.csproj` added to the solution.

#. After the two projects are created, add the app project to the test project as one of the projects to be tested::

        dotnet add [location of your test csproj file] reference [location of the csproj file for project to be tested]

   For example, inside the UnitTestProject1 folder, issue ``dotnet add MathAppTest reference MathApp``. You should see:

   .. code-block:: bash

       tychen@mac:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch13SelectedTopicsLab/UnitTestProject1$ dotnet add MathAppTest reference MathApp
       Reference `..\MathApp\MathApp.csproj` added to the project.

Preparing Code
--------------

In your application folder, we know there is a default Program.cs file created when we run 
``dotnet new console``. Same thing, when we run ``dotnet new mstest``, there is a ``UnitTest1`` created 
automatically for you to use. Now revise the content of the two files. 

The content of the console app ``Program.cs`` in your MathApp folder should look like the code below, 
filled with a class ``BasicMath`` containing 4 basic arithmetic operation methods 
(note that the namespace is critical for the test project to access this app project)::

    namespace SomeMath
    {
    
        internal class Program
        {
            private static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            }
        }
        
        public class BasicMath
        {
            public double Add(double num1, double num2)
            {
                return num1 + num2;
            }

            public double Subtract(double num1, double num2)
            {
                return num1 - num2;
            }

            public double divide(double num1, double num2)
            {
                return num1 / num2;
            }

            public double Multiply(double num1, double num2)
            {
                // To trace error while testing, writing + operator instead of * operator.
                return num1 + num2;         ///// this will fail!!!!!
            }
        }
    }

You would want to run ``dotnet build`` in the app project folder to make sure there is no errors::

    dotnet build

The content of the ``UnitTest1`` file in the MathAppTest folder, on the other hand, should 
look like this (note the ``Assert`` method works in debug compilation to take in a Boolean condition 
as a parameter, and shows the error dialog if the condition is false)::

    using SomeMath;             ///// we want to talk to the BasicMath class 

    namespace MathAppTest;      ///// generated when creating project

    [TestClass]                 ///// specify the UNIT (class) to be tested
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        [TestMethod]            ///// specify the UNIT (method) to be tested
        public void Test_AddMethod()
        {
            BasicMath bm = new BasicMath();     // create instance
            double res = bm.Add(10, 10);        // run the method
            Assert.AreEqual(res, 20);           // detect if the answers match
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_SubtractMethod()
        {
            BasicMath bm = new BasicMath();
            double res = bm.Subtract(10, 10);
            Assert.AreEqual(res, 0);
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_DivideMethod()
        {
            BasicMath bm = new BasicMath();
            double res = bm.divide(10, 5);
            Assert.AreEqual(res, 2);
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void Test_MultiplyMethod()
        {
            BasicMath bm = new BasicMath();
            double res = bm.Multiply(10, 10);
            Assert.AreEqual(res, 100);
        }
    }

You would want to run ``dotnet build`` in the test project folder to make sure there is no errors::

    dotnet build

Now if you run ``dotnet test`` inside UnitTestProject1, you should see the results like:

.. code-block:: bash

    tychen@mac:~/workspace/introcscs/Ch13SelectedTopics/UnitTestProject1$ dotnet test

Run Testing in VS Code
-----------------------

You should also be able to run the test using VS Code for better visualization of the tests. You may need to 
install an extension such as C# Dev Kit for the purpose and build/rebuild the test project in Test Explorer to make the tests show 
up in Testing section of the Activity Bar.
