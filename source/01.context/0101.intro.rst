Introduction
=========================

Motivation
------------

This book, originally inspired by the work of Andrew N. Harrington and George Thiruvathukal (2021)[Ref]_, serves as the primary set of lecture notes for IST-1551, an introductory computer programming course at Missouri S&T.

I recognize that most of my students are likely being formally introduced to computing and computer science for the first time. As such, this introductory textbook is designed to focus on the fundamental concepts of computer science, while also incorporating key ideas from information systems. By connecting technical topics to real-world management contexts, the goal is to enhance students' understanding and make the material more relevant and accessible.
  
C# has gained popularity in recent years and has become the default programming language for the .NET platform. However, this book focuses on the fundamental concepts that are common across general-purpose programming languages. Students with prior experience in other languages will be able to relate their existing knowledge to the material presented here, strengthening their understanding of core computer science principles. The book begins with basic procedural programming skills, then moves on to data structures, algorithm design, and ultimately class-based object-oriented programming, along with a selection of additional relevant topics.

Although the new AI platforms are becoming strong in automated code generation, the industry 
will always have good use of strong computer scientists, system engineers, data scientists, 
and cybersecurity experts, etc., and I am sure that people who hold those positions will always 
need great problem-solving skills. This course and this book aim to serve that need. 


C#, .NET, and VS Code
---------------------

Albeit the overall popularity of JavaScript and Python, Java and Microsoft .NET languages 
remain as strong general-purpose languages. Microsoft has, in recent years, made C# a 
central language for their fast-evolving, open-sourced, and cross-platform .NET ecosystem. 
C# is general-purpose, high-level, multiple-paradigm, and is gaining market share as a popular 
programming language [#f1]_ [#f2]_. Specifically, C# is widely used in areas such as building 
cross-platform applications, web services, and game development. In addition, 
the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, powered by plenty of extensions, has made the editor 
a very powerful tool for coding and programming and worth learning. 

As a general programming language, C# has been used in creating interactive websites, 
mobile apps, video games, augmented reality (AR) & virtual reality (VR), desktop 
applications, and back-end services. For example, the mobile game Pokemon Go is built 
with the Unity game engine and the Stack Overflow website is built with ASP.NET, both
frameworks use C# as their programming language. In general, in terms of job market, 
C# and .NET are especially used by large enterprises.
