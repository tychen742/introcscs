Lab 01
====================================================

Our goals for this lab include:

#. To setup the development tools needed for C# programming.
#. To create your first .NET project for C# development using VS Code.
#. To create a C# "hello, world" app using the terminal.

The two projects created are "hello, world" programs. A "hello, world" program 
is traditionally a simple computer program that outputs a test message similar 
to "Hello, World!" to show that the program's basic syntax works. Nowadays, it is 
used as the first program when learning a new programming language. The origin of 
this convention is known to be from the 1978 book The C Programming Language by 
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, which in turns was inherited from a 1974 
Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, Programming in C: 
A Tutorial [#]_. In the book, it says "[t]he only ways to learn 
a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write 
is the same for all languages" is: 

.. code-block:: C
  
   Print the words 
   hello, world. 


Install VS Code, .NET SDK, and C# Dev Kit Extension 
----------------------------------------------------


#. Install VS Code: 

   Visit the Visual Studio Code `website <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ site or use a package manager 
   to install the current version of VS Code for your operating system. [#]_ An `online version <https://vscode.dev>`_ of VS Code is also available. 

#. Install .NET SDK: 
   
   Visit the `.NET page <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet>`_ and scroll down to click on 
   the "Install the .NET SDK" button. You will be redirected to the 
   `.NET Download <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>`_ page, with the OS, architect, and the recent 
   long term support version of .NET SDK pre-seleted for you to start downlaoding.   
   The download page also includes instructions for the installation and verification of the SDK. 
   At the end of the installation, you should see a notification that the .NET SDK, along with 
   .NET runtime, ASP.NET Core Runtime, and .NET Windows Desktop Runtime are installed.  
  
   .. figure:: ../images/dotnet_sdk_installation.jpg
      :scale: 25% 
 
   To verify if .NET SDK is installed correctly, open a new terminal (e.g., PowerShell in Windows or Terminal in 
   macOS) and run the ``dotnet`` command by type ``dotnet`` and then hit the Enter key. If .NET is correctly 
   installed, you should see results as below.

      :scale: 25% 

      Outcome of running the ``dotnet`` command in terminal

#. Install the C# Dev Kit extension:
  
   Click on the the Extension view icon on the Activity Bar, search and install the C# Dev Kit (this should 
   also install the C# extension from Microsoft). 




Create C# Projects
-------------------------------------------


#. Create project folders:
   
   Follow the following steps at the terminal to prepare the environment for learning C#:   
   
   .. note:: You can perform this task using your computer's GUI but this is an important
       practice, especially if you are new to the terminal/shell.   
   
   #. Start your terminal application. By default, you would be in your user home directory with a command prompt.   
   #. Issue the command ``pwd`` to show your present work path to make sure you are in your user home directory. 
   #. Issue the ``ls`` command and enter to see what files and directories are in the directory.
   #. Create a directory called "workspace" (``mkdir workspace``). ### you may add this folder to the "Trusted Folders & Workspaces" later when prompted by VS Code.
   #. Change directory into the workspace directory (``cd workspace``).
   #. Inside workspace, create a directory introcscs (``mkdir introcscs``)
   #. Inside workspace, create another directory called tests (``mkdir tests``)
   #. ``ls`` to make sure that you have two directories created: introcscs and tests.
   #. Change directory up one level (``cd ..``) or just ``cd ~`` to go back to the your user home directory.
   #. Use the ``exit`` command to leave the terminal.   
   
   The process should look like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tychen@mac:~$
      tychen@mac:~$ pwd
      /Users/tychen
      tychen@mac:~$ mkdir workspace
      tychen@mac:~$ cd workspace
      tychen@mac:~/workspace$ mkdir introcscs
      tychen@mac:~/workspace$ mkdir tests
      tychen@mac:~/workspace$ ls
      introcscs tests
      tychen@mac:~/workspace$ cd ..
      tychen@mac:~$ exit   
   
   To rename a file or a directory, use the ``mv`` ("move") command. For example: 
   ``mv ist_1551 introcscs`` will rename a folder called ist_1551 to introcscs.


#. Start VS Code 

   There are two ways to start VS Code:  

   #. Open VS Code by clicking on the app icon in your computer.   
   #. Alternatively, in the terminal, ``cd`` into the project folder ("tests" 
      in this example) that you want to work on and type ``code`` to start 
      VS Code with the folder as the working directory shown in the Explorer view. 
   
      .. note::     
         A VS Code workspace/folder has a ``settings.json`` file in the ``.vscode`` directory for you to 
         further configure the project. Also, checking out the VS Code docs to `get started <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs>`_ with the 
         first steps of learning how to use VS Code. 


#. Create a C# Hello World app project (hello1)

   You are encouraged to create a *single solution for this course*, with all the projects 
   that you create in the solution. We will first practice by creating a *solution* with 
   a *project* in it. 

   We will create our first "hello, world" app project in the "tests" (the solution) folder 
   in your "workspace" folder by going through the following steps: 
    
   #. In a newly opened VS Code window, click on the Explorer view and choose 
      "Create .NET Project" and then "Console App" from the Command Palette dropdown menu. 
      Alternatively, you may use Cmd-Shift-P, Win-Shift-P, or View --> Command Palette 
      to bring up Command Palette, and then type .NET: New Project, then select 
      "Console App" as your project template. 
       
      .. figure:: ../images/create_dotnet_project.jpg
         :scale: 30%
         

   #. Choose the project directory. In our example here, **Open** the *tests* directory
      that we created in the workspace directory under the user home directory.  
    
   #. Choose a name for your project. In this example, type hello1 as the project name
      and Enter to confirm the name and Enter again to confirm the project path. 
      You should see the hello1 project created along with a test.sln solution file. 

      .. figure:: ../images/hello1_project_created.jpg
         :scale: 30%

   #. Click to expand the hello1 project directory and you should see the Program.cs file. Click to open the file in the editor. 

      .. figure:: ../images/hello1_program_cs.jpg
        :scale: 30%
       
   #. To run the hello1 app, you have to run it as part of a project. From the menu bar, choose Run --> Run without Debugging. Alternatively, you can run the app by choosing the "Run project associated with this file" option from the Run Code icon (the ▷ right-pointing triangle in the upper right corner of the editor menu bar). 

      When run successfully, you should see the building process and the 
      code execution result in the TERMINAL panel:

      .. code-block:: bash
         
         tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests$  /Users/tychen/.vscode/extensions/
         ms-dotnettools.csharp-2.39.29-darwin-x64/.debugger/x86_64/vsdbg 
         --interpreter=vscode --connection=/var/folders/6t/bfp06fh96wn60n_mjtxmbhfm0000gn/T/
         CoreFxPipe_vsdbg-ui-3e9ba55f636d4549b58b7e6499b27762 
         Hello, World!

      .. figure:: ../images/hello1_world.jpg
         :scale: 35%
       
      .. note::     
         
         If you click on Run Code triangle, you may see an error message in the 
         OUTPUT panel. Just use the terminal : 

      .. code-block:: none 

         [Running] scriptcs "/Users/tychen/workspace/tests/hello1/Program.cs"
         /bin/sh: scriptcs: command not found
         [Done] exited with code=127 in 0.017 seconds

   Sometimes using VS Code to run projects can be tricky. For now, let us use the terminal 
   to run our C# projects as follows.


#. Create another C# Hello World app project (hello2)
   
   Here you will create another project, call it hello2, to output "Hello, World". 
   But this time we are going to do that by issuing commands at 
   the command line instead of using VS Code as the tool. The process should look as 
   the code block below. We first create (``mkdir``) another project folder called hello2 in the 
   solution folder tests, then ``cd`` into the folder and issued two dotnet commands 
   to create the app. 

   You can either start your terminal app and change into workspace to perform the 
   following tasks; or you may use the TERMINAL panel in VS Code.


   .. code-block:: bash     
      
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests$ ls
      hello1    tests.sln
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests$ mkdir hello2
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests$ ls
      hello1    hello2    tests.sln
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests$ cd hello2
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests/hello2$ ls
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests/hello2$ 
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests/hello2$ dotnet new console
      The template "Console App" was created successfully.
      
      Processing post-creation actions...
      Restoring /Users/tychen/workspace/tests/hello2/hello2.csproj:
         Determining projects to restore...
         Restored /Users/tychen/workspace/tests/hello2/hello2.csproj (in 145 ms).
      Restore succeeded.
      
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests/hello2$ dotnet run
      Hello, World!
      tychen@mac:~/workspace/tests/hello2$ 
   

   As you can see, the outcome of running project hello2 is the same as project 
   hello1.
