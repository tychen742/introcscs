Example: Sum Numbers in File
-------------------------------

We have summed the numbers from 1 to ``n``.  In that case we generated
the next number ``i`` automatically using ``i++``. We could also read numbers
from a file containing one number per line (plus possible white space)::

      static int CalcSum(string filename)
      {
         int sum = 0;
         var reader = new StreamReader(filename);
         while (!reader.EndOfStream) {
            string sVal = reader.ReadLine().Trim();
            sum += int.Parse(sVal);
         }
         reader.Close();
         return sum;
      }

.. index:: File class; Exists
   Exists - File class method

Below is a more elaborate, complete example with some data quality control,
that also exits gracefully if you give a bad file name.
If you give a good file name, it skips lines that contain only whitespace.  

.. note:: 

    Note that this example uses the ``UI`` class. You can simply copy the file 
    ``ui.cs`` to the project folder like before. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/sum_file/sum_file.cs

A useful method used in ``Main`` for avoiding filename typo errors 
is ``File.Exists`` in the ``System.IO`` namespace :: 

    bool File.Exists(string filenamePath) 

It is true if the named files exists in the operating system's file structure. 
For files in the current folder, you can just use the plain file name.  


.. bin/debug
    It is in the right form for the program.  If you run the program and enter the
    response:

    .. code-block:: none

       numbers.txt

    you should be told that the file does not exist.  Recall that the executable
    created by Xamarin Studio is two directories down through :file:`bin` 
    to :file:`Debug`.  This is the default 
    *current directory* when Xamarin Studio runs the program.
    You can refer to
    a file that is not in the current directory.  
    A full description is in the next section, but briefly, what we need now:
    The symbol for the parent directory is ``..``.  
    The hierarchy of folders and files are separated by
    ``\`` in Windows and ``/`` on a Mac,  so you can test the program successfully
    if you use the file name:
    ``..\..\numbers.txt`` in Windows and ``../../numbers.txt`` on a Mac.  On a Mac, running 
    the program looks like:

    .. code-block:: none

       Enter the name of a file of integers: ../../numbers.txt
       The sum is 16
    
.. bin/Debug
    In :ref:`fio` we will discuss a more flexible way of finding files to open, 
    that works well in Xamarin Studio and many other situations.

Safe Sum File 
----------------

a.  Copy :download:`../../examples/introcs/sum_file/sum_file.cs` to a file :file:`safe_sum_file.cs` 
    in your project of the chapter. 
    Modify the program: Write
    a new method with the header below. Use it in ``Main``, in place of the ``if`` 
    statement that checks (only once) for a legal file::         
   
      // Prompt the user to enter a file name to open for reading.
      // Repeat until the name of an existing file is given.
      // Open and return the file.
      public static StreamReader PromptFile(string prompt)

b.  A user who completely forgot the file name could be stuck in an infinite loop!
    Elaborate the function and program, so that an empty line entered means
    "give up", and ``null`` (no object) should be returned.  The main program needs to
    test for this and quit gracefully in that case.
    

Copy to Upper Case
--------------------------

Here is a simple fragment from example file :repsrc:`copy_upper/copy_upper.cs`.
It copies a file line by line to a new file in upper case:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/introcs/copy_upper/copy_upper.cs
   :start-after: chunk
   :end-before:  chunk
   :dedent: 9

You may test this in the Xamarin Studio example project copy_upper:  

#.  Expand the copy_upper project in the Solution pad.  The project
    includes the input file.  You may not see it at first.  You need to expand the folder
    for :file:`bin` and then :file:`Debug`.  You see :file:`text.txt`.  
#.  To see
    what else is in the project directory, 
    select
    "Open Containing Folder" or "Open in Finder" on a Mac.  
    You should see project file :file:`text.txt` but not :file:`upper_text.txt`.
    Leave that operating system file folder open.  
#.  Go back to Xamarin Studio and run the project.  Now look at the
    operating system folder again.  You should see :file:`upper_text.txt`.
    You can open it and see that it holds an upper case version of the contents
    of :file:`text.txt`.

This is another case where the ``ReadToEnd`` function could have eliminated the loop::

    string contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
    writer.Write(contents.ToUpper());
