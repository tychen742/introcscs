Motivation for This Book
=========================

I was preparing materials for a C# introductory course and found several good resources, among them 
the Introduction to Computer Science in C# book by Andrew N. Harrington and George and George 
Thiruvathukal (2012-2021). It is a great source but since it is copyrighted without an open source 
license, I felt it'd take the chance to prepare my lecture notes to better tailer to the 
students that I serve. 

I had in mind that most of my students are probably being formally exposed to computer science 
for the first time. As an introductory textbook, I therefore intend to focus on the essential 
topics of computer science, while covering some ideas in informatoin systems to provide 
some real world context to facilitate understanding and learning. 
  
C# is gaining popularity in recent years, but this book covers the common topics as 
a general computer language. For the students who come to the class with background in other 
computer langues, they will be able to easily associate their prior learning with the covered topics 
and enhance their concepts and skills in computer science. Basic procedural language skills will 
be introduced first, followed by basic data structure, algorithm design, and finally class and 
object-oriented programming and selected topics. 


C#, .NET, and VS Code
---------------------
Microsoft has made C# a centeral language for their fast-evolving open-sourced cross-platform .NET 
ecosystem. C# is general-purpose, high-level, multiple-paradigm, and is gaining market share 
as a popular programming language [#f1]_ [#f2]_. In recent years, C# has remained widely used 
especially for building cross-platform applications, web services, and game development. 
Meanwhile, the popularity of the VS Code editor, powered by plenty of extensions, has made the 
editor a very powerful tool for coding and programming.
