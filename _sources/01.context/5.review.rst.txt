#. Follow the following steps at the CLI terminal to prepare the environment for learning C#:
   
    #. Start your terminal application. By default, you would be in your user home directory. 
    #. Issue the command ``pwd`` to show your present work path to make sure you are in your user home directory.

    #. Create a direcotry called "workspace" (``mkdir workspace``).
    #. Change directory into the workspace directory (``cd workspace``).
    #. Inside workspace, create a directory ist_1551 (``mkdir ist_1551``)
    #. Inside workspace, create another directory called tests (``mkdir tests``)
    #. Go up one level into the workspace directory (``cd ..``)
    #. ``ls`` to make sure that you have two directories listed: ist_1551 and tests.
    #. Change directory up one level (``cd ..``) or just ``cd ~`` to go back to the user's home directory.
    #. Use the ``exit`` command to leave the terminal.
