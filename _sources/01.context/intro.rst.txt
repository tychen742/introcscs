============================

This book is prepared for a class at Missouri University of Science and Technology: 
IS&T 1551 Implementing Information Systems: User Perspective. The structure of this book 
is based on the book, Introduction to Computer Science in C# at Loyola University, Chicago.  
This book is rewritten with different sets of resources prepared and therefore is a different book, 
but for additional resources, the authors Andrew N. Harrington and George Thiruvathukal have made 
their materials available online: (v)

*   `The course example file, <https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoBooks/introcs-csharp-examples/archive/master.zip>`_
    is the *essential resource* to download and unzip onto your machine.
    The zip file and the folder it unzips to have a long name,
    introcs-csharp-master-examples.  
    We suggest you *rename the unzipped folder*
    ``examples`` to match later references.  
    
*   http://introcs.cs.luc.edu is an online text version for your web browser.  
    See also :ref:`alt-formats` for pdf and epub versions.
    Except on very geometrically oriented topics, 
    *text-oriented learners may be happiest just reading the book*
    in one of these formats.  

*   https://luc.box.com/CSharpVideos is a box.com folder containing all the videos. The numbers at the beginning of the titles are chapter and section numbers from the text.

*   https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoBooks/introcs-csharp/
    is the home page for the repository of all the sources for the book.
        
*   https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoBooks/introcs-csharp-examples/
    is another repository containing the *latest versions*
    of the source code files. You can quickly browse and view individual files under the Source tab.
    Example file links throughout this text refer to these repository files.
