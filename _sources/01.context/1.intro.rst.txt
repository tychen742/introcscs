Introduction
=========================

Motivation
------------

This book serves as lecture notes for an introductory computer programming course: 
IST 1551 at Missouri S&T. 

I had in mind that most of my students are probably being formally exposed to computer science 
for the first time. As an introductory textbook, I therefore intend to focus on the essential 
topics of computer science, while covering some ideas in informatoin systems when teaching 
to provide some real world context to facilitate understanding and learning. 
  
C# is gaining popularity in recent years, but this book is about the common topics of
a general computer language. For the students who come to the class with background in other 
computer langues, they will be able to easily associate their prior learning with the covered topics 
and enhance their concepts and skills in computer science. Basic procedural language skills will 
be introduced first, followed by introduction to data structure, algorithm design, and finally 
class and object-oriented programming, plus some selected topics. 

Although the new AI platforms are becoming strong in automated code generation, the industry 
will always have good use of strong computer scientists, system engineers, data scientists, 
and cybersecurty experts, etc., and I am sure that people who hold those positions will always 
need great problem-solving skills. This course and this book aim to serve that need. 


C#, .NET, and VS Code
---------------------

Albeit the overall popularity of JavaScript and Python, Java and Microsoft .NET languages 
remain as strong general-purpose languages. Microsoft has, in recent years, made C# a 
centeral language for their fast-evolving, open-sourced, and cross-platform .NET ecosystem. 
C# is general-purpose, high-level, multiple-paradigm, and is gaining market share as a popular 
programming language [#f1]_ [#f2]_. Specifically, C# is widely used in areas such as building 
cross-platform applications, web services, and game development. In addition, 
the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, powered by plenty of extensions, has made the editor 
a very powerful tool for coding and programming and worth learning.
