Motivation for This Book
=========================

I was preparing materials for a C# introductory course and found several good resources, among them 
the Introduction to Computer Science in C# book by Andrew N. Harrington and George and George Thiruvathukal (2012-2021). 
It is a great source but since it's copyrighted, I felt obligated to rewrite the book out of respect of 
the authors' rights. In addition, I am preparing the materials and tools for my students and 
I would like to tailer the content, the code, and the examples into their needs. (v)

I have in mind the readers will be the students in their computer sicence 1 class; meaning they may be 
exposed to computer science for the first time. As an introduction textbook, I intend to focus on the 
conceptual framework of computer science. I would also like to cover some ideas in informatoin systems,
as I think it is a good idea to provide some real world context to facilitate understanding and learning. (v)
  
C# is gaining popularity in recent years, but this book covers the common constructs and topics as 
a general computer language. For the students who come to the class with background in other computer langues, 
they will be able to easily associate their prior learning with the covered topics and enhance their 
concepts and skills in computer science. Basic procedural language skills will be introduced, followed by 
basic data structure, algorithm design, and finally class and object-oriented programming and selected topics. (v)


C#, .NET, and VS Code
---------------------

Microsoft has made C# the centeral language for their now open-sourced .NET platform, which is a fast evolving cross-platform 
technology. Meanwhile, the popularity of the VS Code editor with plenty of extensions has made the 
editor a very powerful tool for programming. (v)
