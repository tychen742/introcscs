Motivation for This Book
=========================

I was preparing materials for a C# introductory course and found several good resources, among them 
the Introduction to Computer Science in C# book by Andrew N. Harrington and George and George 
Thiruvathukal (2012-2021). It is a great source but since it's copyrighted without an open source 
license, I felt it'd make sense to rewrite the book to tailer materials and tools to my 
students' needs. 

I had in mind the readers will be the students in their computer sicence 1 class; meaning they may be 
exposed to computer science for the first time. As an introduction textbook, I intend to focus on the 
essential topics of computer science while covering some ideas in informatoin systems to provide 
some real world context to facilitate understanding and learning. (v)
  
C# is gaining popularity in recent years, but this book covers the common constructs and topics as 
a general computer language. For the students who come to the class with background in other 
computer langues, they will be able to easily associate their prior learning with the covered topics 
and enhance their concepts and skills in computer science. Basic procedural language skills will 
be introduced first, followed by basic data structure, algorithm design, and finally class and 
object-oriented programming and selected topics. (v)


C#, .NET, and VS Code
---------------------

Microsoft has made C# the centeral language for their now open-sourced .NET application platform, 
which is a fast evolving cross-platform technology in the world of business information system and 
game development. Meanwhile, the popularity of the VS Code editor, powered by plenty of extensions, 
has made the editor a very powerful tool for coding and programming. (v)
